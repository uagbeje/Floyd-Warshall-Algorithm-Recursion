# The Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-Recursion

# Introduction
This python program aims to rewrite the Floyd algorithm recursively as a single function that calls itself.

Whereas this solution can be implemented iteratively, it can also be implemented recursively.

This python application implements the Floyd Warshall Algorithm using recursive techniques. 

The performance of the recursive technique is compared against an iterative implementation, using various methods to measure performance.

Please see the main report submitted as a word document.

This python package is written using PEP 8 guidelines.

# Progamming language
